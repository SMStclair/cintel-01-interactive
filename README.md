# cintel-01-interactive
We'll implement a working interactive web app written in Python running in the browser. We'll do all the work in the Shiny Playground in our browser (e.g. Chrome). Then we'll create a new GitHub repo to store our project code (we won't host a Pages app yet) - we'll use the Shiny Playground links and screenshots to share our work.
